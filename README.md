## Introduction
The repository contains the work done on computation of Couette-Poiseuille flow with a mixing-length model of turbulence. This work
was done as of part of turbulence practices - <code>Individual Research Project</code> at Ã‰cole centrale de Lille, France as a part of
Masters program in Turbulence. The project was a supervised of Dr. Jean-Philippe LAVAL.

<code>Objective:</code> 
To write a simple program for a turbulent model for a simplified case and compare the results with the <code>theoritical solutions</code> in                         the <code>laminar case</code> and with the <code>experimental</code> results in <code>turbulent case</code>. Several parameters such as grid stretching, number of grid points near the walls are investegated.

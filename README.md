## Introduction
The repository contains the work done on computation of Couette-Poiseuille flow with a mixing-length model of turbulence. This work
was done as of part of turbulence practices - <code>Individual Research Project</code> at Ã‰cole centrale de Lille, France as a part of
Masters program in Turbulence. The project was a supervised of Dr. Jean-Philippe LAVAL.

<code>Objective</code> of this research was to write a simple program for a turbulent model for a simplified case and compare the results with the theoritical solutions in the laminar case and with the experimental results in turbulent case. Several parameters such as grid stretching, number of grid points near the walls are investegated.


The work on computations of Couette-Poiseuille flow with a mixing-length model was done as of part of Turbulence Practices - Individual Research Project (8 ECTS) course supervised by Dr. Jean-Philippe Laval during the coursework of Master's Program in Turbulence. The objective of this course was to program a turbulent model in a simple case and to compare the results with the theoretical solution in laminar case, and with experimental results for the turbulent case. As the case was simple, the effect of several parameters such as the number of grid point as well as the grid stretching near the wall were investigated. The attached report contains the details of the case investigated, the governing equations, the details of computation code as well as discussions on the results obtained.

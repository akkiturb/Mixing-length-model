# Mixing-length-model

Turbulent mixing length model.

The repository contains the work done on computation of Couette-Poiseuille flow with a mixing-length model of turbulence and this
was done as of part of Turbulence Practices - Individual Research Project at Ã‰cole centrale de Lille, Lille, France as a part of
Masters program in Turbulence by and was supervised by Dr. Jean-Philippe LAVAL.

The key objective of this research was to write a simple program for a turbulent model for a simplified case and compare the results with the theoritical solutions in the laminar case and with the experimental results in turbulent case. Several parameters such as grid stretching, number of grid points near the walls are investegated.
